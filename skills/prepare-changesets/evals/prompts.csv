chain-basic,"You are in a git repo with base branch main, source branch feature/test, and a validated plan at .prepare-changesets/plan.json. Using the prepare-changesets skill, run preflight, create the changeset chain, validate mergeability with tests using python3 -c \"print('ok')\", and compare the fully merged chain to the source branch. Do not modify the source branch. Use scripts/*.py directly."
chain-compare,"Follow the prepare-changesets skill strictly. The plan is already validated at .prepare-changesets/plan.json for base main and source feature/test. Create the changeset chain, run validate-chain with python3 -c \"print('ok')\", and run compare. Keep the source branch immutable."
